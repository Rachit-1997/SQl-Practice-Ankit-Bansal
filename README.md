# SQl-Practice-Ankit-Bansal
# 📘 SQL Practice – Ankit Bansal YouTube Series

This repository contains my personal SQL practice based on Ankit Bansal's YouTube SQL problem series. 
Instead of copying answers, I tried to **frame my own logic** to enhance my problem-solving and analytical thinking.


## 🔍 My Approach

While the questions are based on playlist, I made it a rule to:
- First solve each query **on my own** before watching the video.
- In case of differing logic, trying to understand the flaws or creating sample datasets using AI where my logic fails. 
- Document any logic that differs from the original or adds something unique.

This helped me understand flow of logic & concept & develop deeper confidence in SQL logic — not just memorizing syntax.

## 📁 Repo Structure
- `Q1_to_Q83/` : Folder containing `.sql` files for each question.
- `README.md`  : This file, explaining purpose and approach.

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- PostgreSQL  
- ChatGPT, Deepseek  (AI support for sample generation & validation)
- Data from description in youtube videos

## 🧠 Topics Practiced:
- Window functions (RANK, LAG, LEAD)
- Aggregates & GROUP BY
- Subqueries & CTEs
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, SELF)
